# Simple Snake Game

Welcome to the Simple Snake Game! This project is a basic implementation of the classic snake game, reminiscent of the old mobile games we enjoyed in the past.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to control the snake and eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

2. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
   - The snake will continuously move in the current direction until you change it.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
   - The score increases with each food item consumed.

4. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
   - You can restart the game after it's over.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.
